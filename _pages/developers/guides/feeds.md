# Overview

`Experiences` created in the `EXP platform` may want to include `third party data sources` in some cases.
The `EXP platform` has a build in `Data Aggregator` that simplifies getting data in your `Experiences`.
We `unified` the data sources as much if possible to a `simple Json format`, this way a app can easily `switch` between sources without being `modified`.
`FEEDS` can be accessed by EXP Player SDK or via one of the available EXP SDK's.

- [JavaScript SDK - Reference](http://docs.goexp.io/developers/reference/javascript-sdk-1.0.0/)

- [Python SDK - Reference](http://docs.goexp.io/developers/reference/python-sdk/)

- [Player app SDK - Reference](http://docs.goexp.io/developers/reference/player-app-sdk/)

- [IOS SDK - Reference](http://docs.goexp.io/developers/reference/ios-sdk/)

- [Android SDK - Reference](http://docs.goexp.io/developers/reference/android-sdk/)

# Integration
Most of the `FEEDS` in the `EXP platform` require permissions to access the online `third party` data source. 
The `EXP platform` has a integration section to select what online data source is to be used. 
Here the required `credentials` can be entered and will be stored under the used `organisation`. 
Each user of this `organisation` will have access to these `integrations`.

![Data Source Integration](/common_images/developers/integrations.png "Data Source Integration")

## Adding a Integration
- Find the `integration` source that your app will use and press the `ADD` button. 

- A `redirect` will happen to the login permission page of the `third party` online data source provider.

- Enter `credentials` and `accept`. 

- The `integrations` page will appear again. 

When the `integration` fails a `error message` will appear.

When the `integration` is successful added it's `registered` under configured `integrations`.

## Updating Integration
If for any reason the `integration` needs to be updated, for example a permission setting that has changed, the `UPDATE` button can be selected. 

## Removing a Integration
When removing a `integration` the `EXP platform` will attempt to `revoke access` it received from the `third party` provider. 
Some `third party` providers do not allow this `revoke access` to happen automatically, in this case the `EXP platform` will show a warning and give a `link` to manually remove it.
     
# Feed Sources
The `EXP platform` supports multiple `third party` online data feed sources. Not all of then `require` a `integration`.
We can list them by category:

## Social media

1. `Facebook` -> integration Facebook
2. `Instagram` -> integration Instagram
3. `Twitter` -> integration Twitter
4. `LinkedIn` -> integration linkedIn

## Spreadsheet

1. `Google Spreadsheet` -> integration Google Drive
2. `Microsoft Spreadsheet` -> integration Microsoft oneDrive

## Calendar

1. `Google Calendar` -> integration Google Calendar
2. `Microsoft Calendar` -> integration Microsoft Calendar

## POS

1. `Shopify` -> integration Shopify
2. `Square` -> integration Square

## Git

1. `Github` -> integration Github
2. `BitBucket` -> integration BitBucket

## Other

1. `Weather` -> no integration
2. `RSS` -> no integration
3. `Generic` -> no integration

# FEEDS
When the `integrations` are added to the `EXP platform` `FEEDS` can be created in the `FEEDS` section.
In here the default view is a list of `FEEDS` already created. Icons will show what `type` of `FEED` is defined. 
Other info like `created`, `modified` and `search` is also displayed in this view.

![Feed](/common_images/developers/feed.png "Feed")

## Add feed
- Select the `ADD` button on the right top corner to add a `FEED`.

![Feed](/common_images/developers/feed_add.png "Adding New Feed")

- When `ADD` feed is selected a popup box appears. A valid unique `name` can be entered and a `FEED` type can be selected. A list appears of `integrations` if required.
Depending on what `FEED` is selected multiple options can be entered like `search`, `max items` and more. The `details` of these fields will be highlighted later in this `guide`. 

- When done press the `SAVE` button.

## Viewing data
When a `FEED` is created and added to the list a `preview` of the data can be generated.
 
- Select the `FEED` in the list by selecting the checkbox. 
- In the top right a `preview` icon appears. This triggers a feed `preview` generation.

![Feed](/common_images/developers/feed_preview.png "Feed Preview Button")

- A dialog opens to show the preview data in `Json` format. 
- The `data` can be downloaded pressing the `DOWNLOAD` button in the bottom right corner.

## Remove Feed
In the `FEED` main list, select the feed that needs to be deleted using the `checkbox`. Select the delete `icon` to remove the `FEED`.

`WARNING` it is possible that there are currently apps using this `FEED` that is to be deleted!

## Feed Json Structure
The structure of the `Json feed` that the `EXP platform` returns when calling a `FEED` is `unified` as much if possible. 
In the top of the Json structure the `search details` are found with details on the requested `FEED` like what `url` is called or what is `searched` on.
Then the `details` of the requested follows in the structure, including `profile`, `page`, `shop` or `account` info depending on the `FEED` requested.
The `items` section is the actual `data` returned from the `FEED` search. Fields that can differ per feed is located in the `metadata` field. The `raw` field contains the original information.  
   
```json
{
  "search": { ... info about the search ... },
  "details": { ... profile, page, shop, or account info ... },
  "items":[
    "date": "",
    "text": "",
    "shares": 0,
    "likes": 0,
    "comments": 0,
    "images": [ { "url": "" } ],
    "videos": [ { "url": "" } ],
    "links": [ { "url": "" } ],
    "metadata": {
      "startDate": "",
      "endDate": "",
      "high": { "c": 0, "f": 0 },
      "low": { "c": 0, "f": 0 },
      "current": { "c": 0, "f": 0 },
      "amount": 0
    }
    "tags":[], // array of strings
    "createdBy": "",
    "createdByDisplay": "",
    "type": "",
    "raw": { ... original data from search ...}
  ]
}
```

## Dynamic Feeds
In some cases it could be that multiple `FEEDS` are `required`. As example depending on the `location` for `weather information`.
This can lead to a `large` amount of `FEEDS` in the `EXP platform` making it hard to manage it all. 
In this case `FEEDS` can be created with the `dynamic` option. All other options can then be send as a `parameter` next to the `UUID` to the `EXP platform` using the `EXP SDK's`. 

### Create Dynamic Feed
- In the feed section click on the `ADD` button.

- Select a valid `name` for the `FEED`.

- Select a `type` and `integration`.

- Check the `dynamic` option. All other fields will be `removed`.

### Preview 
The `FEED` can be tested in the `EXP platform` when selecting the feed in the feed list and clicking the preview `icon`. 
A `preview modal` appears. On top you can find the `fields` that are send as parameters next to the UUID.
Enter all fields required and press `PREVIEW` to see the data returned.

### Exceptions
There are a couple of `FEEDS` not available as `dynamic`. They are the `RSS` and `Generic` feed types.
