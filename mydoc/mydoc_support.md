I'm actively developing this theme. Please let me know about any bugs or other issues that you find. Just email me at <a href="mailto:replace-me@scala.com">replace-me@scala.com</a>. You can also [create issues directly within the Github repository here](https://github.com/scalainc/exp-docs/issues).
